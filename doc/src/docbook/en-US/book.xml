            <title>Document Conventions</title>
            <para>This manual uses several conventions to highlight certain words and phrases and
                draw attention to specific pieces of information.</para>
            <para>In PDF and paper editions, this manual uses typefaces drawn from the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> set.
                The Liberation Fonts set is also used in HTML editions if the set is installed on
                your system. If not, alternative but equivalent typefaces are displayed.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Typographic Conventions</title>
                <para>The following <application>typographic</application> conventions are used to
                    call attention to specific words and phrases. These conventions, and the
                    circumstances they apply to, are as follows.</para>
                <para>System input, including shell commands, file names and paths, and key caps and
                    key-combinations are presented as follows.</para>
                <blockquote>
                    <para>To see the contents of the file
                            <filename>my_next_bestselling_novel</filename> in your current working
                        directory, enter the <command>cat my_next_bestselling_novel</command>
                        command at the shell prompt and press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the
                        command.</para>
                </blockquote>
                <para>The above includes a file name, a shell command and a key cap, all
                    distinguishable thanks to context.</para>
                <para>Key-combinations can be distinguished from key caps by the symbol connecting
                    each part of a key-combination. For example:</para>
                <blockquote>
                    <para>Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the command.</para>
                    <para>Press <keycombo>
                            <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
                            <keycap>Alt</keycap>
                            <keycap>F1</keycap>
                        </keycombo> to switch to the first virtual terminal. Press <keycombo>
                            <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
                            <keycap>Alt</keycap>
                            <keycap>F7</keycap>
                        </keycombo> to return to your X-Windows session.</para>
                </blockquote>
                <para>The first sentence highlights the particular key cap to press. The second
                    highlights two sets of three key caps, each set pressed simultaneously.</para>
                <para>If source code is discussed, class names, methods, functions, variable names
                    and returned values mentioned within a paragraph are presented as
                    follows.</para>
                <blockquote>
                    <para>File-related classes include <classname>filesystem</classname> for file
                        systems, <classname>file</classname> for files, and

        <para>The architecture of AlgoTrader is composed of the following components.</para>

        <para>The trading framework, Base, provides the infrastructure for all strategies running on top
            of it. Base holds the main Esper Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine. It is
            responsible for all domain model objects and their persistence in the database.
            Different market data adapters are available to process live and historical market data.
            On the other end adapters for different execution brokers and venues are available,
            which are responsible for placing orders and receiving executions.</para>
        <para>Base also provides business components for portfolio management, performance
            measurement, risk management, money management, option pricing, reconciliation, Forex
            hedging and parameter optimization.</para>
        <para>On top of Base any number of strategies can be deployed. AlgoTrader has an event
            driven architecture utilizing one dedicated Esper CEP engine per strategy. A strategy
            can deploy any number of SQL-like Esper statements for time-based market data analysis
            and signals generation. Esper statements can invoke any number of procedural actions,
            such as placing an order or closing a position, which are coded in Java. The combination
            of Esper statements and Java Code provides a best-of-both-worlds approach.</para>
        <para>For management and monitoring of the system three different GUI clients exist. The
            AlgoTrader JMX client provides trading related functionality and general JVM management
            functionality. The EsperHQ client manages the Esper CEP engine. The Grails client is a
            generic client for reference data management.</para>

                <title>Account</title>
                <para>An Account represents either an actual account, an account group (IB specific)
                    or an allocation profile (IB specific). An account is assigned to a particular
                    OrderServiceType (e.g. IB_NATIVE or IB_FIX). In addition there is the field
                    sessionQualifier which is needed to define the actual session in place
                    (primarily for FIX Connections). With this setup, it is possible to have
                    multiple Sessions (SessionQualifiers) per OrderServiceType and to have multiple
                    Accounts per Session.</para>
                <note>
                    <para>Orders sent to the market will always contain Account related information
                        in an adequate way (e.g. as a FIX Tag 1). Also Transactions which are based
                        on an actual trade will have an association with a particular Account.
                        However Positions do not hold any information regarding Accounts. It is
                        therefore possible that a Position holds aggregated Quantities from several
                        external Accounts. With this setup Strategies do not have to worry about the
                        actual Accounts the funds are located in. This way, a strategy will always
                        only see one Position per Security.</para>

                <title>Position</title>
                <para>For any Strategy holding a particular Security in its portfolio a Position will be created
                    in the database. Even if this position is later on closed (i.e. quantity = 0)
                    the position will still remain in the database, because the associated
                    Transactions still have references to it.</para>
                <para>In general, position values (e.g. marketPrice, marketValue, averagePrice, cost, unrealized
                    / realized PL) are calculated per actual strategy related position and show the
                    price that would need to payed if the position was closed at this moment</para>
                <para>Since some values (e.g. marketValue) depend on whether the position is long or
                    short, aggregated position values for the same security (of different
                    strategies) cannot be retrieved just by adding position values from the
                    corresponding strategies. Example:</para>

                <title>Esper Utility classes</title>
                <para>If a computation is too complex, it is not advisable to do it inside an Esper Statement.
                    For this purpose, it is often easier to create a small Utility class and use its
                    methods inside the statement. Example:</para>
                <programlisting language="Java">package ch.algotrader.strategy;

public class MovUtil {

  public static BigDecimal getExitValue(Direction direction, BigDecimal currentValue) {

    double exitValue = Direction.LONG.equals(direction) ?
      currentValue.doubleValue() * 0.98 :
      currentValue.doubleValue() * 1.02;

    return new BigDecimal(exitValue);
  }
}</programlisting>
                <para>This Utility class also needs to be declared in the file
                        <filename>esper-mov.xml</filename>:</para>
                <programlisting language="XML">&lt;auto-import import-name="ch.algotrader.strategy.MovUtil"/&gt;</programlisting>
                <para>Now, the Utility class can be used in an Esper Statement like this to adjust a
                    trailing stop loss:</para>
                <programlisting>@Name('ADJUST_EXIT_VALUE_FUTURES')
@Subscriber(className='ch.algotrader.service.PositionService.setExitValue')
select
  position.id as positionId,

  Tick as tick,
  method:LookupUtil.getPositionBySecurityAndStrategy(
    tick.security.id, engineStrategy.name) as position,
  method:MovUtil.getExitValue(position.direction, tick.currentValue) as exitValue
where
  ((position.direction = Direction.SHORT and exitValue.val &lt; position.exitValue)
  or

                <title>Storing the latest Market Data Events</title>
                <para>For many parts of the strategy it is necessary to keep the last Market Data Event of each
                    subscribed Security. The following statement will do exactly this and save the
                    latest market data event per security for up to one week.</para>
                <programlisting>@Name('CURRENT_MARKET_DATA_EVENT')

where
  marketDataEvent.dateTime.time >
  (current_timestamp - DateUtil.getDuration('WEEK_1'));</programlisting>
                <para>If all market data events over a certain period need to be kept (e.g. for
                    display in a chart), it is recommended to use a named window in the following
                    fashion:</para>
                <programlisting>@Name('MARKET_DATA_WINDOW')

                <para>The above statement will save the first market data event per minute for a
                    total time of up to one hour. Because named windows do not store corresponding
                    events automatically, they have to be inserted with a statement like
                    this:</para>
                <programlisting>@Name('INSERT_INTO_CURRENT_VALUE_WINDOW')

                <title>Market Data Event Prefeeding</title>
                <para>When starting up a strategy in Live Trading Mode, it is often necessary to
                    initialize technical indicators that have a look-back period (see <xref linkend="MovStarter"/> for further details). This initialization is done by
                    feeding historical market data to the Esper Engine.</para>
                <para>A typical prefeed method will look like this:</para>

  Date date = DateUtils.addHours(new Date(), -1);
  Collection&lt;Tick> ticks = getLookupService().getTicksByMinDate(securityId, date);

  EsperManager.coordinate(strategyName, ticks, "dateTime");
  EsperManager.startCoordination(strategyName);
}</programlisting>
                <para>This method will load all ticks for the security (defined by securityId) for
                    the last two hours. It will then feed all of them sequentially to the local

                    Market Data (i.e. Ticks) are not delivered in the format of Bars, it is often
                    necessary to create Bars from arriving Ticks. The chapter <xref linkend="Creation_of_Bars_based_on_Ticks"/> explains how to do this.</para>

                    actual Security that the strategy is interested in, is evaluated and subscribed
                    to at runtime. There are often steps that should take place immediately after
                    the first market data event has arrived for such a security.</para>

                <para>Often a Java Action is triggered multiple times by a certain situation,

                <para>Example: The current market level exceeds a defined stop, therefore a closing
                    order is placed. However during the time that the order is being executed at the
                    market, another market data event is received. Because the position is not yet

                <para>If the variable needs to have an initial value, the variable has to be

create variable ch.algotrader.enumeration.State state =

                <para>It is then possible to query current state inside Esper statements like

            <para>In Live-Trading Mode PortfolioValues are recorded to the database for all running
                strategies on an hourly basis. In addition PortfolioValues are recorded every time a
                transaction occurs that actually influences performance. For the Base these are
                Credits and Debits and for strategies, these are Rebalances. The corresponding value
                of the transaction is recorded in the optional attribute cashFlow of the
                PortfolioValue.</para>
            <para>In Simulation Mode PortfolioValues are recorded to the file portfolio.csv through

            <title>PortfolioValue Restoration Feature</title>
            <para>In case a transaction (that actually influences performance) needs to be recorded
                for a prior period in time, all PortfolioValues since that time period are invalid
                and need to be restored. Usage of this feature is quite common in Reconciliation
                where a CashTransaction has to be recorded for the last trading day as soon as the
                external reconciliation file arrives.</para>
            <para>Through the class <classname>RestorePortfolioValueStarter</classname> which uses
                    <classname>PortfolioPersistenceService.RestorePortfolioValues</classname>
                PortfolioValues can be restored for the specified strategy and time period. For the
                restoration of each PortfolioValue all corresponding transactions up to that time
                have to be evaluated. For that reason PortfolioValue Restoration takes a
                considerable amount of time.</para>

            <title>Margining </title>
            <para>Both Options and Futures are fully margined securities. The actual margin required by a
                broker will vary, however they normally mirror the margin requirements defined by
                the corresponding market. </para>

                    <para>Fills and Transactions are separated from each other for the following

                        reference to the Order). Whereas a Transaction contains all the information
                        related to accounting (i.e. references to position and strategy). In
                        addition to Transactions related to Fills, there are Transactions that are
                        independent of Fills (i.e. Deposits, Withdrawls, Intrest, etc.).</para>

                <para>The <classname>OpenOrderWindow</classname> is updated based on every
                    OrderStatus event (e.g. increase filledQuantity &amp; reduce remainingQuantity).
                    Once the Order is fully executed, it will be removed from the

                <para>If an order does not receive either an Acknowledgment or Fill 1 sec after

            <title>Generic Events</title>
            <para>In addition to MarketDataEvents (i.e. Ticks and Bars) there are general purpose
                Generic Events that can contain any type of information (e.g. virtual market data,
                signals, exposure values, etc.). In contrary to MarketDataEvents, which are sent
                from the Base to the subscribed strategies, these Generic Events are sent from one
                strategy to one or more receiving strategies. A Generic Event class has to subclass
                    <classname>GenericEventVO</classname>. Subscription to Generic Events is based
                on the class of the Generic Event.</para>
            <para>Example: To subscribe to a Generic Event of type Signal (which is a subclass of
                    <classname>GenericEventVO</classname>), the following needs to be done:</para>
            <programlisting language="Java">Class&lt;?&gt;[] genericEvents = new Class[] { Signal.class };
subscriptionService.subscribeGenericEvents(genericEvents);</programlisting>
            <para>To send a GenericEvent, use the following method:</para>
            <programlisting language="Java">EsperManager.sendGenericEvent(signal);</programlisting>
            <para>It is also possible to feed Generic Events via CSV Files in Simulation Mode. To
                enable this, the following VM argument has to be set:</para>
            <screen>-DdataSource.feedGenericEvents = true</screen>
            <para>The filename of the CSV File has to be according to this schema:</para>

            <para>In addition to <methodname>getHistoricalBars</methodname> the two methods
                    <methodname>updateHistoricalBars</methodname> and
                    <methodname>replaceHistoricalBars</methodname> are available to save historical
                bars directly into the database into the table Bar. The method
                    <methodname>updateHistoricalBars</methodname> will save newly retrieved Bars
                after the last Bar currently in the database. Bars before the current last Bar will
                not be touched. The method  <methodname>replaceHistoricalBars</methodname>  however
                will replace all current Bars in the database within the specified time period. Both
                methods can be invoked via the <classname>HistoricalDataStarter</classname>.</para>

            <para>In General different Securities are traded with different numeric precision (e.g. S&amp;P
                Futures prices are two digits, whereas FX prices are usually 5-6 digits). To
                accommodate different numeric precisions, AlgoTrader provides the following two

            <para>For many use cases abstract services are in place which can be extended for
                different market channels.</para>
            <para>For abstract services where there will only be one concrete implementation active
                (through profiles), an alias can be defined for the concrete service (e.g.
                    <classname>iBAccountService</classname>,
                    <classname>iBMarketDataService</classname>). A typical Profile configuration
                inside <filename>applicationContext-xxx.xml</filename> looks like this:</para>
            <screen language="XML">&lt;alias name="iBOrderService" alias="orderService"/>
&lt;alias name="iBMarketDataService" alias="marketDataService"/>  </screen>
            <para>At runtime this service can now be accessed through its alias (e.g.

            <para>For abstract services where there will potentially be more than one concrete
                implementation active (through profiles), aliases are not available. In this case
                the following method can be used to look up all available concrete services that

                    overwritten by a Sub-Strategy (because the load order of individual strategy

                mandatory to specify a namespace however. If a namespace is left out, the variable

            <title>Esper Threading</title>
            <para>Esper has several options for enabling a multi-threaded environment, see <ulink url="http://esper.codehaus.org/esper-4.9.0/doc/reference/en-US/html_single/index.html#api-threading">Esper API Threading</ulink>
            </para>
            <para>In Live-Trading Mode AlgoTrader uses outbound threading with 3 threads by default.
                This means that all Subscriber / Listener Tasks are handled by a thread-pool of 3
                threads. Subscribers / Listeners working in parallel is generally not a problem as
                long as they do not modify the same Entity at the same time. However if two
                Subscribers / Listeners modify the same Entity (e.g. a Position) at the same time,
                this could lead to an inconsistent state in the database.</para>
            <para>For this purpose AlgoTrader uses general database isolation levels as well as
                Hibernate's optimistic and pessimistic locking.</para>

        <section id="Hibernate_Caching">
            <title>Hibernate Caching</title>
            <para>In order to prevent having to access the database on every single request,
                Hibernate provides two types of caches:</para>
            <variablelist>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>First Level Cache</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The First Level Cache is always associated with the current Session.
                            Hibernate uses this cache by default. Its main purpose is to reduce the
                            number of SQL queries needed to execute within a given transaction.
                            Instead of updating after every modification done to an object
                            separately, it updates the database only once at the end of the
                            transaction. At the end of a Session, the attached First Level Cache
                            will be destroyed. In case an Object, that is already loaded into the
                            current First Level Cache, is modified outside the Session, the First
                            Level Cache will not get notified of the change. </para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>Second Level Cache</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The Second Level Cache is always associated with the Session Factory.
                            While processing transactions, Hibernate stores objects at the Session
                            Factory level, so that those objects will available to the entire
                            system. Whenever a new query is executed, Hibernate will first checks
                            with the Second Level Cache to see whether the objects are available in
                            the Cache.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
            </variablelist>
            <para>Both First and Second Level Cache require a Hibernate Session. Creation of a
                Session is usually very quick (a few milliseconds). This mechanism is therefore fine
                for any request-response based system. </para>
            <para>However this approach is not feasible for a trading application. A trading
                application typically receives several thousand market data events per second.
                Ideally these market data events have to be matched to the latest data stored in the
                database (e.g. Security related information, current Positions, executed Trades,
                etc.). However opening a new Hibernate Session for every market data event, to
                synchronize related objects (like corresponding Security), is much too
                expensive!</para>

            <title>Trading Idea</title>
            <warning>
                <para>The purpose of this Strategy is to demonstrates many of the capabilities of AlgoTrader. Do
                    not use it with a Live Trading Account and real Money! Due to frequent Draw
                    Downs, it might lead to large losses. Even when modifying or extending the
                    Strategy use extreme caution before trading it Live.</para>
            </warning>
            <para>The Strategy trades the EUR.USD FX Market and is based on the Stairstep Breakouts (SSBO)
                Indicator that is presented on <ulink url="http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=302007">www.forexfactory.com</ulink> by <ulink url="http://www.forexfactory.com/forexhard">forexhard</ulink>.</para>
            <para>The Trading Idea behind the Strategy is the following: Markets will often stay within a
                trading range for a considerable amount of time before they break-out in either
                direction. The following Chart shows some examples of trading ranges.</para>

            </figure>
            <para>After a break-out markets might return back into the trading range but will
                eventually make a major move in one direction.</para>
            <para>According to the defined settings, the Strategy looks for a trading range with a
                minimum length in Minutes (e.g. 90 Minutes) and a maximum width in Pips (e.g. 30
                Pips). The chart below displays a typical trading range in dark blue color.</para>

                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>As soon as trading range has been built according to these parameters, the
                Strategy waits for the first break-out to happen. The strategy enters the market in
                the direction of the breakout as soon as a small margin called buffer (dashed red
                line, e.g. 5 Pips) has been crossed. In the example above, this happened at
                10:48.</para>
            <para>The Strategy will set a stop at the opposite side of the box (e.g. 1.3618 = 39
                Pips) and a target with the same distance (e.g. 1.3544 = 39 Pips).</para>
            <para>If the target is reached, the Strategy resets itself and waits for a new Box to
                build itself.</para>
            <para>If the Position gets stopped out (at the opposite side of the Box), The Strategy
                waits for the next break-out to happen (on the same Box) and enters the market again
                after the buffer-line has been crossed. This time the size of the position is
                doubled in order to cover the losses of the first entry, in case the target is
                reached this time around. Position size is doubled up to a defined maximum. Because
                of this doubling the system can be categorized as a Martingale Strategy (see <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%29">Martingale
                    Betting System</ulink>).</para>
            <note>
                <para>The SSBO indicator does not dictate doubling of positions. Using the SSBO
                    indicator as a Martingale system is only one of many possible ways to handle a
                    loss. </para>
            </note>
            <para>The following State Chart Diagram depicts the different states the Strategy will
                pass through:</para>

                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>The default setting of the Strategy will go up to level 5 which will result in a
                position size of 16 times the original size. So the individual sizes on the
                different levels will be: 1, 2, 4, 8 &amp; 16. Each successful series will therefor
                present a profit of 1 unit. Very often series will be successful on a level that is
                below the maximum level (e.g. below level 5). However if the Strategy has a loosing
                set, which will be terminated at the maximum level (e.g. at level 5), there will be
                a loss of 16 times the original position size.</para>
            <para>The Strategy will often have multiple successful series in a row before having one
                major draw down. A typical performance chart will therefore look like this:</para>

                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>To prevent having open positions over the weekend the Strategy does not create any
                new boxes after a defined time on Friday (e.g. 4PM). Also, it will terminate a
                potential ongoing series at a defined time on Friday (e.g. 10PM)</para>
